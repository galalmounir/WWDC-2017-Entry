 #              Binary & Gates
 
 Now let's move on to the next section.
 Logic gates are one of the most important aspects of computer science.
 We will start by discussing three of the main types of logic gates: AND, OR, and NOT.
 
 Have a look at the gates on this page and try to come up with the output of each of them (click on the gray box to change the output colors). When you're done, click on the Done button. Refer to the following points for extra help.
 
 * AND: Requires all input to be ON for the output to be ON
 * OR: Requires any of the inputs to be ON for the output to be ON
 * NOT: Inverts the input and applies it to the output
 
 ***NOTE:***
 *  Green = ON = 1
 *  Red = OFF = 0
