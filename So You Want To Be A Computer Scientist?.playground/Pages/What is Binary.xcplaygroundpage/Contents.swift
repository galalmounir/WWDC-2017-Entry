 #              What is Binary?
 Computers use a numbering system called **Binary**. As the name suggests it consists of only 2 numbers. 0 and 1. We call this a Base-2 number system.
 
 What we use in everyday life however is a more common number system -- the Decimal system, which is a Base-10 number system. This consistes of 10 numbers starting from 0 to 9.
 
 Use this page to count up to 13 in Decimal and see how it compares to counting up to 13 in Binary.
