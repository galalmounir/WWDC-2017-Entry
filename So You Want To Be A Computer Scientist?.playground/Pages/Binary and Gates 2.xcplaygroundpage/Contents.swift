 #              Binary & Gates 2
 Logic Gates when combined together can create amazing functions. In order to understand how to come up with your own combinational circuits, let's see if you can figure out the result of this combinational circuit.
 
 Have a look at the gates on this page and try to come up with the output of each of them (click on the output box to change colors). When you're done click on the Done button. Refer to the following points for extra help.
 
 * AND: Requires all input to be ON for the output to be ON
 * OR: Requires any of the inputs to be ON for the output to be ON
 * NOT: Inverts the input and applies it to the output
 
 ***NOTE:***
 *  Green = ON = 1
 *  Red = OFF = 0
